# Poisson Distribution Overview

The poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that gives the probability of
$${k}$$ events occuring in an interval of time $${t}$$ if the events occur with a known
constant mean rate of $$\lambda$$. The poisson distribution can be used for the number
of events in other intervals than time such as distance, area, or volume. However, this
post will focus on time as the interval.
