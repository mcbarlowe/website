Remember all these code snippets must be wrapped in a class method or a
`public static void main` to actually run. For the idea/philosophy
behind loops and how to use them go [here]({{< ref "/python/loops" >}})

# `for` loops

```Java
for (initialization; termination; increment){
    statement(s);
}
```

Real world example:

```Java
//++ operator increments the value by one
for (int i=1; i<11; i++) {
    System.out.println("Your number is: " + i);
}
```

Infinite loop can be created this way:

```Java
for ( ; ; ) {
    //put code here
}
```

Can also loop over an array like in R/Python like this:

```Java
int[] numbers = {1,4,5,2,6,3,6,7}
for (int item : numbers) {
    System.out.println("Your number is: " + i);
}
```

# `while` loops

```Java
while (count < 11) {
    System.out.println("Your number is: " + count);
    count ++;
}
```

# `do-while` loops

The main difference between `while` and `do-while` loops in java is that
`while` loops evaluate the condition for continuing at the beginning of the
loop, and `do-while` evaluates its condition at the end of the loop. This means
a `do-while` loop will run at least once as opposed to a `while` loop which
could never run depending on the condition. You also have to initialize the
variable before you write the loop unlike `while` loops where you can
initialize the variable in the loop declaration.

```Java
int count = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Your number is: " + count);
    count ++;
} while (count < 11);
```
