<p>So if you&rsquo;ve started out doing a little coding either for fun or like me
to try and do data analysis of the NHL, then you&rsquo;ve probably heard people
talk a lot about Git and Github. And if you were like me, you&rsquo;ve even tried
to learn it, or use it, but just got so frustrated you gave up and figured
it wasn&rsquo;t worth the time.</p>
<p>Well this article will try to dispel some of those confusions because
once Git clicks for you, you&rsquo;ll never code without it. It&rsquo;s such a powerful
tool to fit into your coding arsenal. But before we get into setting up
Git and using let&rsquo;s talk about what Git is and what it does.</p>
<p>This article will be done from a Mac OS X developer point of view. The only
main differences between Mac and a Windows will be how you install and setup
git to work on your system. The actual git commands should be the same no
matter what Operating System (OS) you are on.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-git">What is Git?<a href="#what-is-git" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>First off let&rsquo;s differentiate between Git and Github. Many people use
these terms interchangeably, but they are very different things. Git is
what is called a Version Control System or VCS. To put it simply it&rsquo;s a
software that just tracks the changes you make to the programs you
write. That&rsquo;s all it is at its essence. Like working with a Google doc
tracking changes, Git remembers the changes, and more importantly the history of those changes,
you make to your files.  This allows Git to restore those files to any
previous state in the history of the development of the code.</p>
<p>Now Git itself is self contained to your computer, nobody can
see your changes except for you. Github on the other hand is a website
where you can store your code and the history of your changes saved by Git.
This is where you will send your work when you want to share it with the
world. So keep that in mind when reading the rest of this article. Git is
the program on your computer, and Github is the website where you will
send your code when you want to share it. This also adds the benefit of
an extra back up in case something happens to your system.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-git">Why use Git?<a href="#why-use-git" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Track Changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Git as noted above keeps track of the changes you&rsquo;ve made to your
code throughout the history of developing if used properly. Everytime I
add a new feature to my code I save it in Git. And using Git logs I can
see all the changes I&rsquo;ve made. So if I write something and it messes
everything up I can just go back one step in the Git chain and get things
back up and running.</p>
<p>Obviously this may not be a big deal if you are just writing code that
only you will use yourself. But there&rsquo;s been plenty of times I&rsquo;ve made
changes one night and forgotten what I&rsquo;ve done the next day when I go back
to work on it. And if you are working with multiple people on a project
then this log of changes is invaluable to see what others have done in
the code base. Git also keeps track of the date and time of changes
made as well so you can see who made changes and when those changes
were made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching</li>
</ul>
<p>This is perhaps the most important part about git is that you can
create branches of the code you are working on in order to fix bugs or
create new features. You may be asking now, &ldquo;Why not just create a copy
of the file and work on two copies?&rdquo; Well if you&rsquo;re only working on one
file then you may not need Git, but often you&rsquo;ll be working on multiple
files that often interact with each other.</p>
<p>Trying to keep track manually
of the working copies and copies that are being worked on would quickly
become confusing and could lead to bugs and errors that you&rsquo;d have
to waste futher time tracking down. Git handles all that behind the scenes
so you don&rsquo;t have to. You can create a new branch and make as many changes
all without breaking any of the files you are using until you have properly
tested the new versions.</p>
<p>To use a personal example I recently added the ability to query goalie
stats to my twitter bot. Instead of taking the bot down and working on
the file until the features were added, I created a new branch where I
worked on the new features until they were finished. Once done, I then
merged those changes back into my main script. And in doing this I only
worked on one file the whole time.</p>
<ul>
<li>It works with Everything</li>
</ul>
<p>Git is language agnostic. It works with any programming language out
there whether it&rsquo;s Python, R, C++, or something else, Git doesn&rsquo;t care.
It tracks all changes for all files no matter what they are. In fact
Git works just as well with writing a novel or a story as it does with writing
code! It&rsquo;s near
universiality makes it a common ground for developers to meet and
collaborate on projects.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
