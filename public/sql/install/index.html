        <h2> by Matthew Barlowe</h2>
<br />
<p> This tutorial will
cover the basics of getting PostgreSQL setup on your computer and running. We won't actually
be working with data in this article, but instead the focus is on the nuts and bolts
of what PostgreSQL is and and its structure. But before I get into all that let's start
at the beginning. As always these tutorials will be focused on working in a Mac OS X
environment. The Postgres commands and the SQL syntax should work no matter what, but
the details of installing will be different on a Windows system.</p>
<h2>What is SQL?</h2>
<p>SQL, or sequel as its commonly pronounced, is bascially an acronym that stands for
Structured Querying Language. SQL has been around forever since 1974 and isn't anywhere
near cutting edge in technology. Some may see this as a drawback, but it also has its
advantages as well. One being that it's a well documented system and language, and two
is that most people are at least somewhat familiar with its terminology.</p>
<p>But what does SQL do? Well SQL is the language used to query and manipulate data
in a relational database system. And a relational database system is a system that uses
the relational model; a model consisting of unique keys to create
relations between different tables on the database. Its not really important you
understand this all right now but just keep it in mind for future tutorials.</p>
<h2>What is PostgreSQL?</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is just a flavor of SQL. I chose this one for several reasons. One being
it is noted for its speed, and secondly because it is open source and therefore free.
There are plenty other choices out there such as MySQL or SQLite3 that are perfectly
suitable, but these tutorials will focus on Postgres as it is the one I am most comfortable
using. There are differences between these options, but the basic commands we
wil go over in this series should be universal between all of these systems, however I can't
speak for all of them as there may be slight differences in syntax.</p>
<p>Still the majority of the lessons learned using PostgreSQL and these tutorials will
be portable. </p>
<h2>Installing PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>To get PostgreSQL onto our system we are going to use Homebrew to install the files. If
you don't have Homebrew please refer to this [tutorial](https://barloweanalytics.com/unix/homebrew/) to get
it up and running. So like our other brew installations, Postgres is installed with a
command you may find familiar if you've been following these tutorials.</p>
<pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ brew install postgresql
</code></pre>
<p>And you'll see a whole bunch of text on the screen showing Homebrew installing the
PostgreSQL files. It's often a good idea to skim this output even if you don't understand
it as sometimes the output will have very important info. When installing PostgreSQL this
is one of those times. Because at the bottom it will give you two commands: <code>pg_ctl
-D /usr/local/var/postgres start</code> and <code>brew services start postgresql</code>
<p>There are two major difference between these commands the first one will just start up
the postgres server manually. If you ever shut down the computer then you will have to
start the server again. The second one will keep Postgres running in the background at all
times. This is the option I use, but depending on your computer it may not be best for you.
If you just want to manually start and stop the server you'd use the first command above
to start it and this one to stop it: <code>pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop</code>.
So choose whichever option you'd like and start up your new Postgres server!
<h2>Logging in to Postgres</h2>
<p>Ok now that your server is up and running you'll need to login into the Postgres server
before you can do anything:</p>
<pre><code class='Command Line'>
$ psql postgres
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>psql</code> command is what logs you into the Postgres database server and <code>postgres</code> is
a default database that is created whenever you create/install the Postgres server itself.
This database is used by third party programs and it will be the database you connect to
run database maintenance commands.</p>
<p>So after you type the above command you should see that your prompt changes to something
like this:</p>
<pre><code>psql (10.3, server 10.1)
Type &quot;help&quot; for help.

postgres=#
</code></pre>
<p>A couple notes about background things before we go further. When you brew postgres
Homebrew does a couple things behind the scenes. It tells you in the text it prints out, but
I'm going to highlight them here to make it easier for you. First Homebrew creates a superuser
for the Postgres server with the same name as the OS X User you are currently logged in as.</p>
<p>Secondly it sets trust authentication for local connections meaning you don't need to provide a
password to log into the data base. Obviously, this is a huge security flaw and if you were
going to provide outside access you would change that, but for our purposes in these tutorials
we won't get into how to do that.</p>
<p>Ok back to the prompt above. As you can see it tells us what version Postgres we are running,
and that we can type help for help. But if you're like me, I find when I'm learning something new
those help menus offer no help at all until I get a little knowledge about the system. The next
line is where we'll actually put our commands for the Postgres server. That line tells us we
are connected to the <code>postgres</code> database and the <code>#</code> informs you that you are logged
in as a superuser.</p>
<p>As with my rant in other tutorials about using <code>sudo</code> unless you know
what you are doing don't work as a superuser if you can avoid it. So we are going to create
another user and give them database creation privileges:</p>
<pre><code>postgres=# CREATE ROLE username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'quoted password';
</code></pre>
<p>You would change <code>username</code> and <code>'quoted password'</code> with whatever values
you wanted. Next will give our new user the ability to create a database:</p>
<pre><code>postgres=# ALTER ROLE username CREATEDB;
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating Your First Database</h2>
<p>Ok now that we've created our new user lets logout of the superuser with <code>\q</code> and
log in with your new user with this command <code>psql -U username postgres</code>. The <code>-U</code>
flag just tells postgres that you want to login with that particular user and <code>postgres</code>
is again just the name of the database. Normally you would be asked for the password you created
for the role, but remember that local connections are trusted so you won't need to enter it.
<p>Ok now you should see a command line that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>psql (10.3, server 10.1)
Type &quot;help&quot; for help.

postgres=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see our <code>#</code> has changed to a <code>&gt;</code> indciating that we are not a superuser anymore. So now you&rsquo;re
logged in to your new user lets create a database that we are going to load our data into so we can
play around with it:</p>
<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE DATABASE baseballstats;
</code></pre>
<p>At this moment I'll point out, if you haven't noticed, that all SQL commands and queries will end with
a semicolon. This let's the system know that it has reached the end of the query and there are no more
words to parse. If you hit enter without a semicolon a new terminal will pop up with the <code>=</code> changed
to a <code>-</code>. This means that Postgres is expecting more commands and it will wait until you pass it a semicolon.
This is helpful if you are working with complex queries and you can break them up to make them easier to read,
but can be annoying if you are wondering why your commands aren't working.</p>
<p>So to check and make sure our database is created type <code>\l</code> into the terminal.
This command will give you a list of all the databases on the Postgres server. Commands
beginning with a <code>\</code>, also known as <code>psql</code> commands, don&rsquo;t need a semicolon and will throw an error
if you use one. It is a little confusing but one way to keep it apart is that commands that directly
deal with the data itself need semicolons and commands that interact with the actual database don&rsquo;t. You
should see some output similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>                                       List of databases
     Name      |    Owner    | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |      Access privileges
---------------+-------------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------------
 baseballstats | MattBarlowe | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
 postgres      | MattBarlowe | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
 template0     | MattBarlowe | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/MattBarlowe             +
               |             |          |             |             | MattBarlowe=CTc/MattBarlowe
 template1     | MattBarlowe | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/MattBarlowe             +
               |             |          |             |             | MattBarlowe=CTc/MattBarlowe
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the <code>baseballstats</code> in the table and that the Owner of the database is
the username you created. As <code>Owner</code> of the database that means you have superuser powers over it and
that nobody can even read it until you give them acess to the database.</p>
<h2>Importing Data to the Database</h2>
<p>So we have created our new <code>baseballstats</code> database so lets log into it. Start by typing <code>\q</code>
to log out of the <code>postgres</code> database and now we'll use this command to log into our new database
<code>psql -U username baseballstats</code>, (where username is the username you created above)
and you'll see your command prompt is now this:</p>
<pre><code>baseballstats=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Ok so we have our database running but we don't have any data in yet so that's our next step. Data in a SQL
database is stored in different tables. And it is the relationships between these tables that forms the basis
of the relational database system I touched on earlier. </p>
<p>The data I will be using for this tutorial and all future tutorials can be downloaded at this
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h1oyVfW4xLi-hqfgrNjrY-mNlnx0jSaw">link</a>. In this zip file
is a PostgreSQL backup of the database I created from the <code>.csv</code> files from
<a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">Sean Lahman&rsquo;s baseball database</a>. Once the data
is downloaded and unzipped then to load it into the data base all you have to do is this:</p>
<pre><code>psql baseballstats &lt; baseball.bak
</code></pre>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see a whole bunch of output letting you know the backup is being installed into
the database. Once that is all done log back into your database:</p>
<pre><code>psql -U username baseballstats
</code></pre>
<p>This will log you into the <code>baseballstats</code> database and lets make sure the data is all in there
by doing a simple select:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM appearances LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>
<p>Which should produce output similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>yearID | teamID | lgID | playerID  | G_all | GS | G_batting | G_defense | G_p | G_c | G_1b | G_2b | G_3b | G_ss | G_lf | G_cf | G_rf | G_of | G_dh | G_ph | G_pr

</code></pre>
<p> Thats a lot text and its hard to make sense of, but if you are seeing that means we have great success
and your first database is up and running.</p>
<p>If you come up with a <code>ERROR:  permission denied for relation appearances</code> when you run the above code
you need to login back into your superuser account (which remember is the same name of the OS X you created
the postgres server in) into the <code>baseballstats</code> table with this command <code>psql baseballstats</code>
and then grant privileges to your username you created above with
<code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public to username</code>. After that you should be able to
<code>select</code> the data normally.</p>
